Notes made when going through the [Real World OCaml book](https://dev.realworldocaml.org/toc.html) using an early version of [Caramel](https://caramel.run).

Most of the code is `chapter_dir/sweetness.ml` files.

To execute locally, make sure the latest versions of `caramel` and Erlang/OTP are installed globally, and run e.g. `./run.sh 01` to compile and run sweetness for the given chapter
